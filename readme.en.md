## 1. A STICKY SITUATION: What is Sticklines?

Hello, and welcome to the official guide for Sticklines! You've stumbled upon a deceptively deep puzzle game that blends deck-building strategy with roguelike progression. Here, you don't just play with the tiles you're given; you build the deck you want, creating powerful synergies to rack up insane scores.

### 1.1 The Core Objective

Your goal is simple: meet the score requirement for each level. You do this by strategically placing "Tiles" (the cute, pixel-art characters) from your hand onto a 5x5 grid. When placed, certain tiles will "interact" with other tiles on the grid based on their unique rules, generating points and multiplier bonuses.

Strategic placement is the key. This isn't just about filling the board; it's about seeing the potential in every tile. You must consider not only where a tile can score points now, but how it sets up future plays, how it can be targeted by other tiles, and how it contributes to the grand, point-scoring machine you're building, one hand at a time.

### 1.2 The Roguelike Loop: Run, Shop, Repeat

A "Run" in Sticklines consists of multiple "Antes." Each Ante has three levels: two standard levels and a final Boss Level. The game is built around a satisfying and addictive loop that encourages experimentation and adaptation.

The gameplay loop looks like this:

1. **PLAY a Level**: Use your limited number of hands to draw tiles from your custom deck and place them on the grid to meet the score goal. Each decision matters, as your tiles are a finite resource for that level.
2. **EARN Money**: Beating a level rewards you with cash. This isn't just for a high score; it's the lifeblood of your run, allowing you to invest in your deck's future.
3. **VISIT the Shop**: This is where you make the big decisions. Spend your hard-earned money to buy new tiles for your deck, powerful one-time-use Stickers that provide run-long benefits, or apply permanent Enchantments to your existing tiles, making them more powerful.
4. **ANTE UP**: After beating the Boss Level, you'll "Ante Up." This significantly increases the score requirements for the next set of levels, forcing you to evolve your strategies. But with greater risk comes greater reward, as the shop offerings and potential for high scores also increase.
5. **REPEAT**: Continue this loop, building an ever-more-powerful deck to see how high you can push your score and how many Antes you can conquer. Each run is a new puzzle, a new set of opportunities.

### 1.3 Why This Design? The Philosophy of Fun

Sticklines was designed to be endlessly replayable. The combination of a customizable deck, random shop offerings, and strategic choices (like skipping levels for unique rewards) ensures that no two runs are ever the same. We want you to feel clever as you discover a new, game-breaking synergy between a tile, an enchantment, and a sticker. The game is a sandbox for creative puzzle-solving, rewarding both careful planning and the ability to adapt to unexpected opportunities.

The fun comes from player expression. Are you an aggressive player who loves high-risk, high-reward tiles like Glass? Are you a meticulous planner who builds an unstoppable economic engine with Shiny enchantments? Or are you a combo master who uses the Duality tile to create mind-boggling chains of events? The game provides the tools; you provide the creativity. It's about that "Aha!" moment when you see how three seemingly unrelated pieces can fit together to shatter a score goal you thought was impossible.

## 2. KNOW YOUR BATTLEFIELD: Understanding the UI

Navigating the world of Sticklines is easy once you know what you're looking at.

### 2.1 The Main Menu

![image](/assets/screenshots/screenshot-1.png)

- **Game Title**: "Sticklines" floats whimsically at the center of the screen, its pixelated font gently bobbing up and down. Behind it, a cascade of the game's colorful tiles fall from the top of the screen, setting a playful-yet-chaotic tone.
- **Start New Run**: This is your main entry point. Clicking this button wipes any previous run progress and starts you fresh from Ante 1 with a basic deck of common tiles. This is how you begin your journey to Sticklines mastery.
- **View Collection**: Located in the top-left, this button takes you to your permanent collection of all the Tiles, Enchantments, and Stickers you've discovered across ALL runs. It's your personal trophy room and a valuable resource for learning about what the game has to offer.

### 2.2 The Level Select Screen

![image](/assets/screenshots/screenshot-3.png)

This is your strategic hub between rounds. After a level or a trip to the shop, you'll land here.
- **Level Buttons**: Shows the three levels of the current Ante.
    - *Locked* levels are grayed out and cannot be played.
    - The *Available* level is highlighted, scaled up, and pulses gently, beckoning you to play.
    - Each button displays the score Goal and the money Reward for completion.
- **Start Button**: Appears on the available level. Click it to jump into the action.
- **Skip Button**: A crucial strategic choice! Instead of playing a standard level, you can skip it and receive a random reward. This reward could be a free tile, a free enchantment, or a free sticker. The reward is clearly displayed on the level button itself, allowing you to make an informed decision. These skip rewards are set at the beginning of each Ante and do not change until you Ante Up, so you can plan your path.
- **Ante Complete!**: After clearing all three levels, a large "ANTE COMPLETE!" message appears, and the "Ante Up!" button takes its place, ready to take you to the next, harder set of levels.
- **Sticker Display**: Your current sticker loadout is always visible at the bottom right, a constant reminder of the powerful buffs you have active for the run. You can even sell stickers directly from this screen if you need to make room or get a quick cash infusion.

### 2.3 The Game Screen (The Grid)

![image](/assets/screenshots/screenshot-4.png)

This is where the magic happens.
- **The Grid**: The central 5x5 grid, your digital canvas for creating point-scoring masterpieces.
- **The Hand**: A tray at the bottom of the screen holding the 7 tiles you can currently play.
- **Score / Goal**: At the top, this shows your current score for the level and the target score you need to reach.
- **Score Preview Bars**: This is your most powerful planning tool. As you place tiles on the grid, these two bars show you the *potential* outcome of your current board setup before you commit. The "Score" bar shows the base points you'll earn, and the "Multiplier" bar shows the current multiplier. Your final score for the hand will be `Score * Multiplier`. This lets you experiment with placements without penalty, moving tiles around to find the optimal layout.
- **Hands Remaining**: You only have a limited number of hands to play per level (typically 3, but can be increased by stickers). This display tracks how many you have left.
- **Start Round Button**: When you're happy with your tile placements, hit this button to lock them in, trigger all the interactions, calculate your score, and clear the board for the next hand.
- **Deck Button**: Click this to see all the tiles remaining in your deck, which helps with long-term planning within a level. Tiles currently in your hand or already played are grayed out.
- **Sticker Display**: Also visible here, as your stickers can affect gameplay in real-time.

### 2.4 The Shop: Where Fortunes are Made

![image](/assets/screenshots/screenshot-2.png)

After each level, you're taken to the shop to spend your cash.
- **Money Display**: Shows your current cash in the top-left.
- **Shop Items**: A random selection of goods. These can be:
    - **Tiles**: Buy a specific tile to add to your deck.
    - **Stickers**: Buy a powerful sticker. You can only hold 5 at a time!
    - **Enchantments**: Pay an "Enchanter's Fee" to purchase an enchantment, which you can then immediately apply to one tile of your choice from your deck.
- **Reroll Button**: Don't like what's for sale? Pay a small, increasing fee to reroll the entire shop inventory. A cheap reroll can sometimes be the best investment you make.
- **Continue Button**: When you're done shopping, click this to return to the level select screen.
- **Sticker Display**: You can manage your stickers here, including selling them back for half their purchase price if you need cash or want to make room for a new one.

### 2.5 The Collection: Your Trophy Room

Accessible from the main menu, this screen tracks your permanent progress across all runs.
- **Tabs**: Switch between viewing discovered Tiles, Enchantments, and Stickers.
- **Item Grid**: Shows every item in that category. Discovered items are shown in full color; undiscovered items are grayed out, their mysteries waiting to be unlocked.
- **Info Panel**: Click on a discovered item to see its full description, rarity, and a count of how many times you've found it. This is a great way to study game mechanics.
- **Sorting**: You can sort items by their default order, by rarity (to see the most powerful items), or by the number of times found to easily see what's common and what's rare in your gameplay history.

## 3. THE BUILDING BLOCKS: A Guide to All Tiles

Tiles are the heart of Sticklines. Understanding their individual strengths and how they combine is the key to victory.

### 3.1 What is an Interaction?

An "interaction" occurs when one tile's effect is triggered by the presence of another tile on the grid. For example, a Blue Tile is defined as "interacting" with every tile in the column above it. Each of these connections is a single interaction. Most interactions generate a base score, but some tiles have unique effects, like adding to the multiplier instead. The core of the game is creating as many valuable interactions as possible.

### 3.2 Common Tiles: The Bread and Butter

These are the foundational tiles you'll start with and build upon.
- **Blue Tile**: A workhorse. It interacts with all tiles directly above it in the same column, all the way to the top of the grid. Great for scoring points on tall stacks of tiles.
- **Red Tile**: The opposite of Blue. It interacts with all tiles directly below it in the same column. Use it at the top of a column to score everything beneath it.
- **Green Tile**: A horizontal scorer. It interacts with all tiles to its left in the same row. Place it on the right side of a row to maximize its potential.
- **Yellow Tile**: The opposite of Green. It interacts with all tiles to its right in the same row. A perfect tile to place at the start of a long row of other tiles.
- **Purple Tile**: The Multiplier King. This tile is purely defensive; it does not start interactions itself. However, when another tile interacts *with it*, it adds +1 to your Multiplier for the round. It doesn't give you points directly, but it makes every point you earn more valuable. A cornerstone of high-scoring builds!

### 3.3 Uncommon Tiles: Changing the Game

These tiles introduce more complex and powerful mechanics.
- **Colorful Tile**: Interacts with all 8 tiles immediately surrounding it (a 3x3 square). This makes it a great way to trigger many interactions at once in a dense cluster of tiles.
- **Munching Tile**: Eats the tile to its left, adding +6 to your Multiplier. (This effect is not yet implemented).
- **Glass Tile**: A powerful tile. It interacts diagonally in all four directions. When it successfully interacts with ANY tile, it grants a massive 100 points. This is a high-risk, high-reward option for when you need a huge score boost to clear a tough level.

### 3.4 Rare Tiles: The Run-Definers

These tiles are so powerful they can shape your entire strategy for a run.
- **Black Tile**: A complex and mighty tile with two distinct states.
    - It interacts with all tiles in the four cardinal directions (all the way up, down, left, and right).
    - **The Lone Wolf Bonus**: If it is placed so that NO other tiles interact with it (e.g., it's surrounded by empty spaces, or only by non-interacting Purple tiles), it provides a colossal **x3 Multiplier**. This often requires sacrificing a turn of point-scoring for a massive future payoff.
    - **The Team Player Bonus**: If other tiles DO interact with it, it still provides a very respectable +10 Multiplier.
- **Duality Tile**: A mind-bending tile for combo enthusiasts. Its effect triggers only if there are tiles on both its immediate left AND right. The effect is a two-step process:
    1.  It first transforms the tile on its left into an exact copy of the tile on its right (copying its color and any enchantments). This copied tile then participates in scoring as if it were the real tile.
    2.  The Duality Tile itself does not score any points or create interactions. Its sole purpose is this powerful transformation effect. This can lead to incredible combos if you plan it right!

## 4. POWER-UPS & PERKS: Enchantments and Stickers

Tiles are just the beginning. True power comes from customizing your tools.

### 4.1 Enchantments: Making Good Tiles Great

Enchantments are permanent upgrades you can apply to a single tile in your deck via the Shop. An enchanted tile gains a sparkling star icon and powerful new abilities that stack.
- **Creative**: Adds a flat +100 to your base score whenever the enchanted tile is on the board and interactions occur. A simple and effective way to boost your points.
- **Productive**: Adds a massive +15 to your multiplier whenever the enchanted tile is on the board during scoring. This can dramatically increase your score, especially in later Antes.
- **Explosive**: A gamble. Gives the tile a 15% chance to explode when scored, removing it from your deck permanently but adding a huge +200 to your score for that hand. A great way to get a final burst of value out of a tile you don't need anymore.
- **Shiny**: An economic powerhouse. Adds +$2 to your money whenever the enchanted tile is scored. Enchanting a common tile with Shiny early on can pay for itself many times over throughout a run.

### 4.2 Stickers: Powerful Passive & Active Buffs

Stickers are purchased in the shop and provide run-wide effects. You can hold up to 5, and their effects combine to create powerful synergies.
- **Mr. Happy (Common)**: Grants +15 score for every single interaction that occurs on the board. This is a fantastic force-multiplier for any strategy, turning a good hand into a great one.
- **RGB (Common)**: Red, Green, and Blue tiles grant an extra +7 score for each tile they interact with. A solid, reliable buff for decks that use the basic scoring tiles often.
- **Hourglass (Uncommon)**: Adds `4 * your current hand number` to the multiplier. This means it's weak on your first hand (+4) but becomes incredibly powerful on your last hand of a level (+12 or more), encouraging you to save your best placements for last.
- **Need a Hand? (Uncommon)**: A passive sticker that permanently increases your maximum hands per level by +1. This is one of the most valuable stickers in the game, as an entire extra hand gives you more chances to score, draw the tiles you need, and meet tough goals.

## 5. HOW TO PLAY: From Beginner to Sticklines Master

### 5.1 Your First Turn

1.  A new level begins. You are dealt a hand of 7 tiles from your deck.
2.  Click a tile in your hand. You are now "holding" it, and a ghost of it will follow your cursor.
3.  Move your mouse over an empty grid cell. You will see a preview of which other tiles it would interact with (they will be highlighted). The Score Preview bars will also update in real-time.
4.  Click the empty cell to place the tile.
5.  Repeat for other tiles. You can place as many or as few tiles as you want from your hand. You can also click a placed tile to pick it back up and move it.
6.  Observe the Score Preview bars. Experiment with different placements to maximize your potential score. This is the "puzzle" part of the game.
7.  When ready, click "Start Round." Your score is calculated, the placed tiles are cleared, and you draw a new hand.

### 5.2 The Art of Placement: Basic Strategy

-   **Clusters are Key**: The more tiles on the board, the more potential for interactions. In general, it's better to place many tiles to create a dense network of scoring opportunities.
-   **Set Up Your Purples**: Purple tiles are useless on their own. Place them where you know your other tiles will hit them. A row of three purples hit by a single Yellow tile can create a huge multiplier from just one active tile.
-   **Think in Columns and Rows**: Use Blue and Red tiles to score entire columns. Use Green and Yellow tiles for rows. Try to build structures that allow a single tile to interact with many others.
-   **Preview is Your Friend**: The interaction preview and the Score Preview bars are your most important tools. Use them constantly to check for unexpected interactions or missed opportunities before you commit to a layout.

### 5.3 Advanced Synergies & Combos

-   **The Duality Switcheroo**: This is a classic advanced combo. Place a weak, unenchanted tile (like a basic Blue) to the left of a Duality tile, and a powerful, heavily enchanted tile to its right. The Duality tile will transform the weak tile into another powerhouse for the turn, effectively cloning your best tile for one glorious round of scoring.
-   **Glass Cannon**: Save your Glass tile for a moment when the board is packed. Use it to hit as many tiles as possible diagonally for a huge point gain. This is especially useful if you're struggling to meet a tough score goal and need one big, explosive hand to win.
-   **The Lone Black Tile**: Engineer a situation where a Black tile can be placed with empty spaces on all four sides, or is only adjacent to tiles that don't interact with it (like a Purple). The **x3 multiplier** is often worth more than any score you could get from direct interactions, especially if you have a decent base score already set up.

### 5.4 The Economy: Earning and Spending Money

Money is your path to power. How you spend it will define your run.
-   **Early Game (Ante 1)**: Focus on building a solid foundation. Buying a few stacks of common tiles can increase the consistency of your deck and ensure you can reliably score. A well-timed "Shiny" enchantment can set up your economy for the rest of the run.
-   **Mid Game (Ante 2-3)**: Start looking for Stickers and Enchantments that complement your strategy. If you have a lot of Purple tiles, look for Productive enchantments. If your deck is diverse, Mr. Happy is a great buy.
-   **Rerolling**: Don't underestimate the reroll button in the shop. If the shop offers nothing useful, spending $1 or $2 to see a new set of items can be the best investment you make, potentially revealing a run-defining rare item.

### 5.5 Skipping Levels: A Strategic Choice

Skipping a level means forfeiting the money reward for a unique, free reward shown on the level select screen. This is a deep strategic choice. It's a good idea when:
-   The reward is a Rare tile or a powerful Sticker that you couldn't afford otherwise.
-   You want to get an Enchantment without paying the Enchanter's Fee, saving you precious cash.
-   You are confident you can beat the next levels and don't need the small cash infusion from the current one. Sacrificing a small, immediate gain for a large, long-term advantage is a hallmark of great roguelike play.

## 6. GAME MECHANICS IN-DEPTH

For those who want to know everything.

### 6.1 Scoring Formula: Score x Multiplier

Each hand is scored with this simple but powerful formula.
-   **Base Score**: This comes from direct tile interactions (usually +10 per interaction) and specific bonuses from Enchantments (e.g., a "Creative" tile on the board) or Stickers (e.g., the bonus from "Mr. Happy").
-   **Multiplier**: This starts at 1 each hand. It is increased by Purple tiles being interacted with, special effects from Rare tiles (like the Black tile), and certain Stickers (e.g., "Hourglass"). Your goal is to increase both sides of this equation.

### 6.2 The Deck: How Drawing Works

-   Your deck is the sum of all tiles you own.
-   At the start of a level, the deck is "shuffled" into a random order.
-   For each hand, you draw a set number of tiles (7 by default) from the available pool. Tiles drawn for one hand are not available for subsequent hands *in the same level*.
-   After the level is won or lost, all tiles are returned to the deck, ready to be shuffled for the next level. This means tiles removed by effects like the "Explosive" enchantment are gone for good.

### 6.3 The Ante System: Upping the Stakes

The Ante system provides a scaling difficulty curve that is central to the roguelike experience. After beating a Boss Level, the base score requirement for all subsequent levels increases dramatically (e.g., from a base of 150 to 750). This forces you to continually improve your deck and find more powerful synergies to keep up. You cannot rest on your laurels; you must evolve or perish. It's the core of the roguelike progression.

### 6.4 Rarity and Randomness

-   Tiles, Stickers, and Skip Rewards have rarities: Common, Uncommon, and Rare.
-   The shop is more likely to offer common items but always has a chance to offer rarer, more powerful ones.
-   This randomness is what makes each run unique and exciting. You must adapt your strategy based on the opportunities the game presents you. A great Sticklines player isn't someone who has one perfect strategy, but someone who can build a winning strategy out of anything the game throws at them.

Thank you for playing Sticklines! We hope this guide helps you on your journey to becoming a master tile-placer. Now get in there and build something amazing!
